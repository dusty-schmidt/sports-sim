# Tennis Project Changelog

## 2024-05-29 - Project Merge & Cleanup

### Environment Standardization ✅
- **Consolidated environments**: Removed 3 separate environments, standardized on single `tennis_env/`
- **Fixed dependency management**: Unified on `pyproject.toml` with editable install
- **Resolved import errors**: Fixed `the_oracle` relative imports and PYTHONPATH
- **Auto-environment setup**: Working `.envrc` with automatic dependency installation

### Data Directory Consolidation ✅
- **Eliminated duplication**: Merged `data/` (186M) and `tennis_data/` (1.1G) into single `data/` directory
- **Preserved all content**: Moved unique directories (`exploratory/`, `processed/`) before consolidation
- **Updated environment**: `.envrc` now points to correct data directory

### Scripts Directory Cleanup ✅
- **Removed 15 outdated test scripts**: Old simulator tests that were redundant
  - `test_simulator.py`, `test_full_simulator_with_clutch.py`, `final_improved_simulator_test.py`, etc.
- **Archived 14 analysis scripts**: Moved to `scripts/archive/` for reference
  - `comprehensive_data_analysis.py`, `calculate_real_player_stats.py`, etc.
- **Removed 9 redundant scripts**: Duplicate or obsolete analysis tools
- **Kept 1 active utility**: `csv_processor.py` remains available
- **Added archive documentation**: `scripts/archive/README.md` explains archived content

### Documentation Cleanup ✅
- **Removed outdated docs**: Old Windows/PowerShell environment setup instructions
- **Removed empty directories**: Cleaned up unused `docs/sim/` folder
- **Updated main documentation**: `docs/README.md` reflects current project structure
- **Kept useful documentation**: DraftKings scoring, ML docs, data decoder

### Simulator Status ✅
- **Both simulators working**: `main_sim` and `the_oracle` both functional
- **Feature comparison complete**:
  - `main_sim`: Momentum ✅, Fatigue ✅, Variance ✅, Pressure ✅
  - `the_oracle`: ML Integration ✅, Betting Analytics ✅, Comprehensive Analysis ✅
- **Test framework**: `test_simulators.py` provides easy comparison

### Project Structure Cleanup ✅
- **Moved test script**: `test_simulators.py` moved to `scripts/` directory
- **Clean top-level**: Minimal files in project root
- **Organized scripts**: All utilities now in `scripts/` directory

### Next Steps
- **Phase 2**: Simulator consolidation - Use `main_sim` as base, migrate `the_oracle`'s ML features
- **Phase 3**: ML integration - Connect `ml_models/` with simulation engines
- **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and enhanced analytics

## 2024-05-29 - Phase 2: Simulator Consolidation Started

### Migration Plan ✅
- **Target**: Enhance `main_sim` with `the_oracle`'s ML and analytics features
- **Keep**: `main_sim`'s momentum, fatigue, variance mechanics (proven and mature)
- **Add**: `the_oracle`'s player profiling, ML insights, betting analytics

### Key Features to Migrate
1. **Enhanced Player Profiling**
   - `UltimatePlayerProfile` class with ML archetype integration
   - `PlayerArchetype` with betting-relevant metrics and surface advantages
   - Structured `StatisticalProfile` and `ShotPatterns` data classes

2. **Unified Data Engine**
   - `TennisOracleDataEngine` for comprehensive data loading
   - Multiple data source integration (Match Charting Project, WTA/ATP, ML models)
   - Intelligent player database building and management

3. **ML Insights & Analytics**
   - ML-based archetype analysis and matchup predictions
   - Betting opportunity detection and edge identification
   - Comprehensive result analysis with configurable depth levels

4. **Enhanced Result System**
   - Rich `UltimateMatchResult` with structured analytics
   - Multiple analysis modes (quick, standard, comprehensive)
   - Organized insights, opportunities, and tactical analysis

### Phase 2 Implementation ✅
- **Enhanced Player Profiling**: Created `EnhancedPlayerProfile` class with ML archetype integration
- **Enhanced Data Engine**: Built `EnhancedDataEngine` that extends main_sim's analyzer with ML capabilities
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Implemented `EnhancedAnalyticsEngine` with ML insights, tactical analysis, and betting opportunities
- **Enhanced Simulation**: Added `simulate_match_enhanced()` method to main_sim with comprehensive analytics

### New Components Added
1. **`enhanced_profiles.py`**: Player profiling system with ML archetypes, statistical profiles, and shot patterns
2. **`enhanced_data_engine.py`**: Data engine that integrates main_sim's analyzer with advanced profiling
3. **`enhanced_analytics.py`**: Analytics engine for generating ML insights, tactical analysis, and betting opportunities
4. **Enhanced simulator method**: `simulate_match_enhanced()` with configurable analysis depth

### Integration Results ✅
- **Both simulators working**: Standard and enhanced modes functional
- **ML features integrated**: Player archetype classification, betting analytics, tactical analysis
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing main_sim functionality preserved
- **Enhanced insights**: Comprehensive match analysis with multiple depth levels
